# Python Project for Data Engineering

1. Collect data using APIs
2. Collect data using webscraping.
3. Download files to process.    
4. Read csv, xml and json file types.
5. Extract data from the above file types.
6. Transform data.
7. Use the built in logging module.
8. Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format which data engineers can use to load the data.

This repo serves as my code for the final project where I have to apply the concepts in the previous exercises.
